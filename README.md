Adding code: <br/>
For now, please add to your own project, not to the listMusicFiles application onthis repository. <br/>
We will do that as a group beginning Monday. <br/>


Testing Process (manual for now):
<br/>
Make sure App runs:  
1. Can I run the app without any build errors  
2. Do I see the music player  
3. Do I see the transport controls (volume, play, etc)  
4. Can I click on the song link and does it load to music player?  
5. Can I play the music and adjust the volume?  
6. Can I stop the music?  
7. Can I select a different song and play it?
