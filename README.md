Overview: <br/>
This README is just a general overview of the repository. The project submission is located in the UWP_MusicAPP_Final folder. There is a separate README in there that gives you a quick overview of our MusicAPP, its capabilities and its limitations.

Below was an overview created by misseswaddles to outline the plan for manual testing. The process underscored the need for putting unit tests and integration tests in place for our next group project.

<br/>

Adding code: <br/>
For now, please add to your own project, not to the listMusicFiles application onthis repository. <br/>
We will do that as a group beginning Monday. <br/>


Testing Process (manual for now):
<br/>
Make sure App runs:  
1. Can I run the app without any build errors  
2. Do I see the music player  
3. Do I see the transport controls (volume, play, etc)  
4. Can I click on the song link and does it load to music player?  
5. Can I play the music and adjust the volume?  
6. Can I stop the music?  
7. Can I select a different song and play it?
